        <h2>Analysis</h2>
        <p>
          Studying Computer Science and the five main computing fields really
          showed me the balance between ideas and practice. The field is built
          on concepts like algorithms and AI, but it also drives the tools and
          technology we use every day. I liked Denning’s point that Computer
          Science is both a science and an engineering discipline,it takes both
          creativity and discipline.<br /><br />The five majors; Computer
          Science, Software Engineering, Computer Engineering, Information
          Systems, and Information Technology each focus on something different.
          I see how important it is to pick the path that fits your strengths.
          For example, Software Engineering is great if you like working in
          teams to build systems, while Information Systems connects business
          and technology. Together, they cover everything from designing
          hardware to managing information. <br /><br />What stood out to me
          most is that computing isn’t just about machines it’s also about
          people, organizations, and global problems. New fields like Data
          Science and Cybersecurity show how the field keeps adapting, whether
          it’s making sense of big data or keeping information safe. That makes
          me confident computing will always be important. <br />
          <br />Overall, this reflection gave me a deeper respect for how wide
          computing really is and how much it can improve people’s lives. It
          also reminded me that success in this field means more than knowing
          the technical stuff it’s about problem-solving, innovation, and using
          technology responsibly in a world that’s always changing.
